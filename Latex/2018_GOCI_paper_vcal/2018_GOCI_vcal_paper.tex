% Wonkook's comments:
% Hi Concha,

% Here I attached the first review of the manuscript.

% Overall impression of the manuscript to me is that a great amount of work
% has been done, but the way it is presented can be improved. It would be
% greatly helpful to readers, if you can summarize what you're going to do
% afterward, in the beginning of each paragraph. To me, it was difficult to
% follow the details, because I couldn't catch the
% direction/approach/intention of each paragraph at the beginning.

% Many comments have been made in the attached file, but here I present 4
% important issues that I'd like to share with the other co-authors.

% (1) Weak logic in showing the temporal homogeneity of GCW
% I'm not totally convinced by the overall concept/approach/logic of this
% section (4.3). GOCI Rrs has been used to show that the GCW region has
% little variability in constituents. But, GOCI Rrs is already contaminated
% by imperfect AC (solar zenith angle issue). I think you need independent
% data source to show that the region has little change in water
% constituents.

% (2) Source of Rrs variability
% In the manuscript, the Rrs variability is sometimes attributed to solar
% zenith angle change (and imperfect AC), and sometimes to variability in
% water constituents. (Section 4.4. the second paragraph). One can be
% analyzed when the other is fixed. If solar zenith angle needs to be
% analyzed, you should either assume that the other factor is constant, or
% remove the effect of the other factors.

% Also, if any prior knowledge about the local variability in the
% bio-geochemical environment is to be used, proper reference needs to be
% added.

% (3) Slot boundary issue
% As I pointed out a few months ago, there is a great radiometric inflation
% in the lower part of each slot (GOCI is composed of 16 (4x4) slots, as you
% know). The inflation has a spatially smooth pattern, and I experienced that
% outlier removal approaches based on spatial statistics (including
% coefficient of variation) cannot screen out the pixels contaminated by the
% inflation. Please verify whether your screening process successfully
% removed those samples. The inflation is sometimes greater than 20% in TOA
% radiance (in 680, 865 nm bands), which is large enough to mess up the AC
% process.

% The cloud edge issue has not been mentioned in the manuscript, but  it is
% highly likely the proposed screening process screen out the cloud edge
% pixels which are not recognized as clouds by the default cloud flag. But, I
% think it is safe to check.

% (4) Vicarious gains and the algorithm coefficients.
% The Navy vicarious gains seems very low in general. I attached my
% validation results that I presented 3 years ago in Ocean Optics. Although
% AC scheme is different, this can give you general ideas of the difference.
% I'm not sure if it is a good idea to show that OBPG GOCI has significant
% underestimation in all bands. To non ocean color people, this may seem as
% inferior performance of GOCI itself (including optics, and data
% processing), not as just biases in VC gains. If possible, application of
% correct VC gains would give much better results in the sense of absolute
% quantification. If relative variation in diurnal cycle is a main focus,
% this issue may be less important.

% Plus, the coefficients for the Chla, POC, aCDOM algorithms are not tuned
% for GOCI. Again, this may provide incorrect estimates in an absolute sense.
% If relative change is to be analyzed, this issue may be less important.

% Best,
% Wonkook Kim
