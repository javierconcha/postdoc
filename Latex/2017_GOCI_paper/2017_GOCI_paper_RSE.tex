\begin{abstract}

% Background/motivation/context
Short-term (hours) biological and biogeochemical processes cannot be captured by heritage ocean color satellites because their temporal resolution is limited to potentially one clear image per day. 
%
Geostationary satellites, such as the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), allow the study of these short-term processes because their orbits permits the collection of multiple images throughout each day. 
% Aim/objectives(s)/problem statement
In order to be able to detect the changes in the water properties caused by these processes, the levels of uncertainties introduced by the instrument and/or algorithms need to be assessed first.
% 
This work presents a study of the variability during the day over a water region of low-productivity with the assumption that only small changes in the water properties occur during the day over the area of study. 
% Methods
The complete GOCI mission data were processed to level 2 using the SeaDAS/l2gen package.
%
Filtering criteria were applied to assure the quality of the data. 
%
Relative differences with respect to the daily mean were calculated for each time of the day. 
%
Also, the relationship between the solar zenith angle and remote sensing reflectances was analyzed.
%
The GOCI time series was compared to the MODIS/Aqua and Suomi-NPP VIIRS missions.
% Results
Preliminary results suggest that the last two images of the day deviate significantly from the prior six hourly images, presenting errors on the order of $30\%$ or higher in the blue and green bands, and higher than $50\%$ in the red bands. 
%
Additionally, the atmospheric correction begins to fail for solar zenith angles greater than 60 degrees. 
% Conclusions

Biological and biogeochemical processes in the coastal zones and oceans can occur in short-term time scales (minutes to hours). Heritage ocean color sensors do not have the temporal resolution needed to capture these diurnal dynamics.

In this paper, a uncertainties analysis was performed ...

The SeaDAS/l2gen code was modified to support NASA standard atmospheric correction for GOCI.

\section{Data and Sensor Characteristics}
% ============================================================
\subsection{GOCI Data}
The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), launched in June 2010, is the only geostationary ocean color sensor currently on space \citep{Ryu2012}. GOCI monitors the Northeast Asian waters surrounding the Korean peninsula, generating up to eight images per day (from 00:15 GMT to 07:45 GMT at one hour rate) with a spatial resolution of 500 m at 130$^o$E and 36$^o$N. It covers an area of about 2500 km$\times$2500 km. It hast eight spectral bands (6 VIS: 412, 443, 490, 555, 660 and 680 nm; 2 NIR: 745 and 865 nm). GOCI operates in a 2D staring-frame capture mode in a geostationary orbit on board of the Communication Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) of South Korea. The acquisition of the observational coverage area of GOCI is done with a step-and-staring method that divides the image in 16 slots acquired in a sequential fashion with a dedicated CMOS detector array ($1400\times1400$ pixels).

The images used in this analysis span from the beginning of the GOCI's mission (June 2010) until December $31^{st}$, 2016\todo{update}, resulting in a total of about 18,000 images. The GOCI Level-1B calibrated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance data were obtained from the Ocean Biology Distributed Active Archive Center (OB.DAAC\todo{correct?}) at the NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, maintained by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) \todo{or OEL?}. The OB.DAAC acts as a mirror site for the GOCI data provided by the Korea Ocean Satellite Center. These data are freely available for direct download from the OB.DAAC. Each file is provided as a  Hierarchical Data Format Release 5 format (file extension: .he5) and corresponds to one of the eight daily images per day. Each file contains eight images corresponding to the eight spectral bands.
% ---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Area of Study}

The area of study (\autoref{fig:AreaOfStudy}) is a boxed area that covers an open-ocean region of oligotrophic waters located to the south of Japan, in the North Pacific Ocean, with the boundaries north$=29.4736^o$, south$=24.2842^o$, west$=131.9067^o$, and east$=142.3193^o$, centered at $27^oN$ and $137^oE$. \autoref{fig:AreaOfStudy} shows the area of study (white box) and the GOCI coverage area (red box) for reference. The area of study is approximately $2000\times 1000$ GOCI pixels, and therefore, covering approximately two million GOCI pixels, equivalent to $500,000\ km^2$. The reasoning behind the selection of this area of study is the assumption that most of the variability in this region during the day will be caused by physical (e.g. wind, waves) changes and not by biogeochemical processes (e.g. $CO_2$ fixation). In this manner the variability due to water composition will be minimized, and therefore, the variability introduced by the sensor, viewing geometry and algorithm can be analyzed. For this region, the range of solar zenith angle during the acquisition time  varies between approximately $0^o$ to $90^o$ through the year, and between approximately $29^o$ to $37^o$ for the sensor (viewing) zenith angle.

\section{Processing Approach}
\label{sec:processing}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Conversion to Level 2}
GOCI Level 1B data (radiometric calibrations applied, L1B) was processed to Level 2 data (geolocated, geophysical values, L2) using the multisensor level 1 level 2 generator (l2gen) version 8.10.2 distributed with the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) (\url{http://seadas.gsfc.nasa.gov/}). The l2gen code reads level 1 observed top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances, applies one of the atmospheric correction scheme available, and output various products such as radiances or reflectances (e.g.  spectral remote-sensing reflectance, $R_{rs}(\lambda)$) and derived geophysical parameter (e.g. chlorophyll-{\it a} concentration). As part of the l2gen processing, each pixel is masked with different flags that reflect warnings or errors generated during the processing. Examples of these flags are atmospheric correction failure, land, cloud or ice, straight light, sun glint, high top-of-atmosphere radiance, among others \citep{Bailey2006}.

The atmospheric correction scheme applied for this study was the default algorithm ({\ttfamily aer\_opt=-2}) that uses an estimation of the aerosol contribution described by \citet{Gordon1994}, including a near infrared (NIR) iterative correction by \citet{Bailey2010} and a selection of the aerosol model dependent of the relative humidity by \citet{Ahmad2010}. GOCI's two near infrared (NIR) bands were used for the aerosol models selection. This approach assumes a plane-parallel geometry, ignoring earth curvature, for the vector radiative transfer simulations used for the computation of the {\todo{taken from Franz 2015} look-up tables of Rayleigh reflectance}. \todo{include BRDF correction} 

A vicarious calibration specific for GOCI was applied (included in SeaDAS). The calibration coefficients are based on match-up with VIIRS and they were derived by the National Research Lab based on AERONET-OC {\it in situ} data.
% ---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Data screening}
% Filtering Criteria
The mean and standard deviation for the whole area of study are calculated for each level 2 product. In order to assure the quality of the data, an exclusion criteria (filtering) was applied. This criteria was based on the criteria described by \citet{Bailey2006} for the validation of ocean color satellite data products. This exclusion criteria is presented in the flowchart in \autoref{fig:FilteringCriteria}. Pixels flagged by the atmospheric correction algorithm are excluded. In order to avoid the effect of outliers in the calculations, the following screening criteria was applied:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:filtered_value}
  (Med-1.5*\sigma) <  X_i < (Med+1.5*\sigma)
\end{equation}
where $X_i$ is the $i^{th}$ filtered pixel within the box, $Med$ is the median value of the unflagged pixels, and $\sigma$ is standard deviation of the unflagged pixels. Then, the filtered mean was calculated:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:filtered_mean}
  \text{Filtered Mean} =\frac{\displaystyle \sum_i^{NFP} X_i}{NFP}
\end{equation}
where $NFP$ is the Number Filtered Pixels, i.e. the number of unflagged values within $\pm 1.5*\sigma$. Note the difference with Equation 4 in \citet{Bailey2006}, where the mean of the unfiltered data was used instead of the median. The use of the median value for the calculation of the filtered mean minimize the influence of outliers. This is the current standard approach adopted by the Ocean Ecology Lab at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. The statistical values filtered mean and standard deviation, among others, were computed operationally using the val-extract tool included in the SeaDAS/l2gen distribution (located on {\ttfamily \$OCSSWROOT/run/bin/macosx\_intel/val\_extract}  for the OSX installation) specifying the latitude and longitude limits as input parameters (slon, elon, slat and elat).

In order to have statistical confidence in the filtered mean value, NFP is required to be at least half the number of total pixels in the box (i.e. $NFP\geq NTP/2 = 998,501$) to be considered into the analysis. This is equivalent to stating that at least half of the area of study has valid pixel values associated with it. Additionally, we excluded data where the solar and viewing zenith angle of the center of the pixel box exceeded $75^o$ and $60^o$ to avoid extreme solar and  viewing geometries \citep{Bailey2006} (\autoref{fig:FilteringCriteria}). 

A coefficient of variation (CV), which is defined as the filtered standard deviation divided by the filtered mean, is calculated for all the visible bands and for the aerosol optical thickness at 865 nm, and the median CV is recorded. Then, the mean and standard deviation of the median CV are calculated for the whole mission ($mean_{Median(CV)}=0.23$ and $\sigma_{Median(CV)}=0.26$, respectively). Finally, level 2 products with median CV greater than $mean_{Median(CV)}+\sigma_{Median(CV)}=0.49$ are excluded.

\subsection{Validation of the Atmospheric Correction}
% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
\subsubsection{AERONET-OC}
The atmospheric correction was validated using {\it in situ} observations from the AErosol RObotic NETwork-Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) as ground truth \citep{Zibordi2009}. The quality-assurance (QA) level used was level 2.0, which is the highest quality for the AERONET-OC data. The dataset from two stations were used for the analysis: Gageocho (N=20; PI: Jae-Seol Shim and Joo-Hyung Ryu) and Ieodo (N=25; PI: Young-Je Park and Hak-Yeol You). \autoref{fig:GOCI_AERO} shows scatter plots for satellite derived $R_{rs}(\lambda)$ versus {\it in situ} measurements. 

The selection of matchups followed the satellite validation protocols described in \citet{Bailey2006}. GOCI data acquired within a three hours windows of the {\it in situ} sampling were considered as potential validation matchups. A $7\times7$ GOCI pixel array is extracted centered in the {\it in situ} sampling location. A filtered mean is calculated from these $7\times7$ arrays using \autoref{eq:filtered_value} and \autoref{eq:filtered_mean} \citep{Bailey2006}. A minimum of at least half the total of pixels in the $7\times7$\todo{From Antonio: Why 7x7 and not 5x5?}~pixel array, i.e. $49/2\approx25$ pixels, were required to be valid (unflagged) for inclusion of the matchup in the validation analysis. Additionally, a coefficient of variation (CV, filtered mean divided by the filtered standard deviation) for the visible bands 412 to 555 nm and the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 864 nm was calculated for each pixel array that passes the exclusion criteria described above, and then, the median value of these coefficients of variation ($\text{Median}[CV]$) was calculated. Finally, the pixel arrays whose $\text{Median}[CV]>0.15$, as suggested by \citep{Bailey2006}, are excluded from the validation analysis.

A validation analysis was performed by comparing the satellite-derived retrievals of products with the {\it in situ} observations based on different statistical parameters (\autoref{tab:val_stats}). These statistical parameters are: the slope and offset of the fitted Reduced Major Axis (RMA) regression line of the form $y=m*x+b$, and its coefficient of determination $R^2$, the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean, standard deviation, and median of the absolute percentage difference (APD)(MAPD, $\pm$sd APD, and Median APD, respectively), the percentage bias, median ratio of computed filtered mean satellite value ($R_{rs:ret}$) to {\it in situ} measurement ($R_{rs:in}$), and the semi-interquartile range (SIQR) \citep{Bailey2006}. These parameters are defined as:
\begin{equation}
  \text{APD$_n$(\%)}=\left[\frac{\displaystyle \left|R_{rs:in}^1-R_{rs:ret}^1 \right|}{R_{rs:in}^1},\dots,\frac{\displaystyle \left|R_{rs:in}^n-R_{rs:ret}^n \right|}{R_{rs:in}^n},\dots,\frac{\displaystyle \left|R_{rs:in}^N-R_{rs:ret}^N \right|}{R_{rs:in}^N}\right]*100,\ n=1,\dots,N
\end{equation}
\noindent where N is the total number of matchups, and $R_{rs:in}^n$ is the $n^{th}$ {\it in situ} $R_{rs}$ and $R_{rs:ret}^n$ is the $n^{th}$ satellite-derived $R_{rs}$.
\begin{equation}
  \text{MAPD(\%)} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \text{APD$_n$(\%)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \text{$\pm$ \text{sd} APD(\%)} =  SD\left[\text{APD$_n$(\%)}\right]
\end{equation}
\noindent with $SD$ the standard deviation.
\begin{equation}
  \text{\text{Median} APD(\%)} =  Median\left[\text{APD$_n$(\%)}\right]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
   \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{N} \left(R_{rs:in}^n-R_{rs:ret}^n\right)^2}{N}}
\end{equation} 
\begin{equation}
    \text{\% Bias} = \frac{\displaystyle \frac{1}{N}*\sum_{n=1}^N(R_{rs:ret}^n-R_{rs:in}^n)}{\text{Mean}[R_{rs:in}^n]}*100
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \text{Median ratio} =  Median\left[\frac{R_{rs:ret}^1}{R_{rs:in}^1},\dots,\frac{R_{rs:ret}^n}{R_{rs:in}^n},\dots,,\frac{R_{rs:ret}^N}{R_{rs:in}^N}\right],\ n=1,\dots,N
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \text{SIQR} = \frac{Q_3-Q_1}{2}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $Q_3$ and $Q_1$ are the $75^{th}$ and $25^{th}$ percentiles for the ratios of the satellite-derived values to the {\it in situ} measurements.  

\autoref{fig:GOCI_AERO} shows the color coded AERONET-OC data divided by group representing the times of the day (early morning: 0h and 1h (blue circles); early midday: 2h and 3h (red circles); late midday: 4h and 5h (green circles); and late afternoon: 6h and 7h (cyan circles)) in order to evaluate the influence of the solar zenith angle in the validation matchups. Also, the data were separated by stations (Gaeocho: circles and Ieodo: triangles). The statistics calculated for each group and for all matchups (highlighted in bold cases) are shown in (\autoref{tab:val_stats}). The largest MAPD value correspond to the 0h\&1h hour for all bands and the smallest MAPD value correspond to the 4h\&5h suggesting that is an influence of the solar zenith angle. However, the number of matchups decreases throughout the day, having only 2 matchups at the end of the day, and therefore, there are not enough data to be conclusive.

When all the data are used for the analyses, a good agreement was found between the retrieved $R_{rs}$ and {\it in situ} observations, with $R^2$ values varying from 0.81 to 0.98 for the 412 to 660 nm GOCI bands, exceeding the values previously reported by \citet{Ahn2015}\todo{From Antonio: it's not worthwhile to compare individual statistics metrics from another paper, but rather a group a statistics; our results show better (or worse) agreement than Ahn et al. 2015 based a combination of metrics (R2, RSME, APD, etc.).}. The validation statistics indicate that the atmospheric correction did not perform as well for satellite retrieval of $R_{rs}$ when compared to the atmospheric correction described by \citet{Ahn2015} that includes a vicarious calibration using {\it in situ} data, which is reflected in a consistently greater mean absolute percent difference (MAPD) and RMSE for all bands. This suggests that the vicarious calibration used can be improved.

\subsection{Time Series}
As mentioned previously (\S\ref{sec:processing}.1-2), the complete GOCI mission was processed to Level 2 and then a filtered mean for the area of study was calculated. Only values that passed the filtering criteria described previously were used \citep{Bailey2006}. The filtered mean of the boxed area for each time of the day are shown in \autoref{fig:GOCI_TimeSeries}.(a-l), where results are plotted as a function of time and histograms for the $R_{rs}(\lambda)$ for all GOCI's bands. The data are color coded by time of the day in GMT (red: 0h, green: 1h, blue: 2h, black: 3h, cyan: 4h, magenta: 5h, orange: 6h, and purple: 7h). The time series exhibit an expected seasonal variability, which is correlated\todo{Check!}~to the changes in solar zenith angles throughout the year (\autoref{fig:GOCI_TimeSeries2}.(g)). Note that for each day there are potentially eight values displayed, which explains the daily spread of the data in \autoref{fig:GOCI_TimeSeries} and \autoref{fig:GOCI_TimeSeries2}. 

There some data that passed the exclusion criteria and have negative values for all bands, reflecting a failure on the atmospheric correction. However, these are few for the 412, 443, 490 and 550 nm spectral bands, and most of them were captured at the time of the day equal to 6h and during winter time, when the solar zenith are the largest. As for the 660 and 680 nm spectral bands, there are more negative values, with the 680 nm band having the largest amount. However, from the histogram for these bands, it can be seen that the mean values are close to zero.

\autoref{fig:GOCI_TimeSeries2}.(a-f) shows time series for the Chlorophyll-{\it a}, $a_{g:mlrc}(412)$ and POC, which were obtained from the filtered mean of $R_{rs}(\lambda)$ using the empirical algorithm described in \S\ref{subsec:bioopalg}.  The data are color coded by time of the day in GMT (red: 0h, green: 1h, blue: 2h, black: 3h, cyan: 4h, magenta: 5h, orange: 6h, and purple: 7h). \autoref{fig:GOCI_TimeSeries2}.(g) shows the time series for the solar zenith angle for reference and color coded by time of the day. As expected, there are more data for spring-summer than fall-winter, when the solar zenith angle is larger and the sky conditions are not optimal (e.g. clouds).

The anomalies of each parameter were then calculated by subtracting the long-term monthly mean (climatology) grouped by time of the day from every time of the day. This is, a mean value was calculated for each time of day (8 times) for every month (12 months). For example, all the 0h time of day for all the Januaries were averaged. Then, this time of the day monthly average was subtracted from the hourly filtered means acquired in all Januaries. This anomalies represent de-seasoned data, i.e. independent of the seasonality. The anomalies of $R_{rs}(\lambda)$ versus the solar zenith angle are shown in \autoref{fig:Rrs_vs_zenith_detrend} color coded by time of the day.

\subsection{Diurnal Differences and Uncertainties}
% Daily standard deviation
A standard deviation (SD) of the eight values per day was calculated. This daily standard deviation is an indicator of the temporal stability of the selected homogeneous ocean region. The hope is to have minimal variation during the day over this region. Then, all of the daily standard deviation were averaged to have a mean value per band. These values are compared to the results obtained from the comparison the AERONET-OC dataset (\autoref{tab:stdev_aero}).

\begin{table}[htbp!]

\end{table}



% Relative difference
There are eight images for each day. For every image, the mean of the entire box was calculated. Then, these mean values were averaged to obtain a daily mean, as follow

\begin{equation}
	\hat{X} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{t}^N x_t
\end{equation}

The difference con respect to a reference is $\Delta_t=x_t-x_{reference}$. Then, the relative difference is defined as
\begin{equation}
	RD_t = \frac{\Delta_t}{|x_{reference}|} = \frac{x_t-x_{reference}}{|x_{reference}|}
	\times 100[\%]
\end{equation}
where $x_t$ is the satellite data at the local time $t=09h,10h\dots16h$ of the day.

\section{Discussion} 
The boxed area is covered by two slots, visually noticeable from the image. This can introduced uncertainties in the process.

% Practical applications  
% Disadvantages and Advantages
% Limitations
% Challenges

% from OO poster
The validation with {\it in situ} data exhibit results comparable to heritage sensors.

Expected seasonality and trends were observed through the complete mission.

The atmospheric correction starts to fail for solar zenith angles larger than 60 degrees producing invalid values (negative). 

Uncertainties vary spectrally, being larger in the blue and decreasing towards the red.

Uncertainty patterns are similar for the six first images of the day, increasing for the last two images across all wavelengths

% future work
Estimation of changes due to diurnal and day-to-day biogeochemical stocks and processes in coastal oceans.

% Javier,

% Results look really interesting regarding 6h and 7h time points (wonder if it’s related to stray light from sun entering FOV at end of the day).  Very good start on the text. Figures look great – may not need all the figures from Fig. 7-13 are needed – let’s discuss this.  Need more descriptive figure captions for Figs. 16-18.  Do you need Fig. 17 if include Fig. 16.  Fig. 19 is really cool that the values match well for the most part.

% Let’s discuss Fig. 20 and 21.  Not sure I agree with conclusion that results get better from blue to red.  The red looks worse than blue to me.  Can you say something about how spatially and temporally homogeneous the study region is?  The temporal homogeneity is critical for the diurnal analysis.  What about day to day variability for the same time of day (e.g., mean and variance of a 3-day analysis at 0h, 1h, 2h, … 7h).  If you can show that from day 0 to day 2 for each time of day that GOCI Rrs (and other products) are similar to the diurnal mean or the mid 3 time points of the day, then you can establish homogeneity.  Maybe pick a 3-day period for each season of 1 year to test?

% Antonio's comments on 6/15/17:

% The main assumption in your analysis and thus applicability of your results is that the study region is homogeneous through the day such that you can discern if there are higher errors at certain times of the day.  So, I’m suggesting an analysis that would further support this primary assumption.  

% 1. Start small - select one 3-day sequence of GOCI images per season in 1 year (when you have 3 consecutive days of clear-sky images).
% 2. Quantify the mean and variance for each time of day … 0h, 1h, etc.  How do the statistics compare with the diurnal analyses comparing values with diurnal average and mid-day average?
% a. The point here is to demonstrate the following:  (1) demonstrate that there is minimal day-to-day and diurnal variability for this study region, (2) are the large errors  you see at 0h, 6h and 7h due strictly to the instrument/processing/SZA and not due to variability in ocean properties.
% b. Compare means and stdev (or other variance statistic) of each time of day (0h, 1h, etc.) with each other as well as with the mid-3 time points.
% 3. If the data are supportive of your assumption and conclusions (or confuse the issue), then maybe go further and analyze additional 3-day sequences.
