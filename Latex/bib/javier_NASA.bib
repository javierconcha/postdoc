	Abstract = {The bidirectionality of the upward radiance field in oceanic case 1 waters has been reinvestigated by incorporation of revised parameterizations of inherent optical properties as a function of the chlorophyll concentration (Chl), considering Raman scattering and making the particle phase function shape ($\beta$̃p) continuously varying along with the Chl. Internal consistency is thus reached, as the decrease in backscattering probability (for increasing Chl) translates into a correlative change in $\beta$̃p. The single particle phase function (previously used) precluded a realistic assessment of bidirectionality for waters with Chl \&gt; 1 mg m-3. This limitation is now removed. For low Chl, Raman emissions significantly affect the radiance field. For moderate Chl (0.1--1 mg m-3), new and previous bidirectional parameters remain close. The ocean reflectance anisotropy has implications in ocean color remote-sensing problems, in derivation of coherent water-leaving radiances, in associated calibration--validation activities, and in the merging of data obtained under various geometrical configurations.},

@article{Twardowski2007,
	Abstract = {<p>During the BIOSOPE field campaign October-December 2004, measurements of inherent optical properties from the surface to 500 m depth were made with a ship profiler at stations covering over 8000 km through the Southeast Pacific Ocean. Data from a similar to 3000 km section containing the very clearest waters in the central gyre are reported here. The total volume scattering function at 117 degrees, beta(t)(117 degrees), was measured with a WET Labs ECO-BB3 sensor at 462, 532, and 650 nm with estimated uncertainties of 2 x 10(-5), 5 x 10(-6), and 2 x 10(-6) m(-1) sr(-1), respectively. These values were approximately 6\%, 3\%, and 3\% of the volume scattering by pure seawater at their respective wavelengths. From a methodological perspective, there were several results: - b(bp) distributions were resolvable even though some of the values from the central gyre were an order of magnitude lower than the lowest previous measurements in the literature; - Direct in-situ measurements of instrument dark offsets were necessary to accurately resolve backscattering at these low levels; - accurate pure seawater backscattering values are critical in determining particulate backscattering coefficients in the open ocean (not only in these very clear waters); the pure water scattering values determined by Buiteveld et al. (1994) with a [1+0.3S/37] adjustment for salinity based on Morel (1974) appear to be the most accurate estimates, with aggregate accuracies as low as a few percent; and - closure was demonstrated with subsurface reflectance measurements reported by Morel et al. (2007) within instrument precisions, a useful factor in validating the backscattering measurements. This methodology enabled several observations with respect to the hydrography and the use of backscattering as a biogeochemical proxy: - The clearest waters sampled were found at depths between 300 and 350 m, from 23.5 degrees S, 118 degrees W to 26 degrees S, 114 degrees W, where total backscattering at 650 nm was not distinguishable from pure seawater; - Distributions of particulate backscattering b(bp) across the central gyre exhibited a broad particle peak centered similar to 100 m; - The particulate backscattering ratio typically ranged between 0.4\% and 0.6\% at 650 nm through the majority of the central gyre from the surface to similar to 210 m, indicative of {\textquoteright}soft{\textquoteright} water-filled particles with low bulk refractive index; and - b(bp) showed a distinct secondary deeper layer centered similar to 230 m that was absent in particulate attenuation c(p) data. The particulate backscattering ratio was significantly higher in this layer than in the rest of the water column, reaching 1.2\% in some locations. This high relative backscattering, along with the pigment composition and ecological niche of this layer, appear to be consistent with the coccolithophorid Florisphaera profunda. Moreover, results were consistent with several expectations extrapolated from theory and previous work in oceanic and coastal regions, supporting the conclusion that particulate and total backscattering could be resolved in these extremely clear natural waters.</p>

@article{Walsh1995,
	Abstract = {As part of the U.S. JGOFS EqPac process study beam c profiles were obtained during two time-series occupations of the equator at 140$\,^{\circ}$W (TT008 and TT012). CTD/transmissometer profiles were routinely performed three times a day, roughly at dawn, noon, and just prior to sunset. Additionally, `diel experiment' days of intensive profiling (every 3 h) were conducted twice during TTW8 and three times during TT012. The beam attenuation profiles clearly show a diel cycle, with morning lows and evening highs. Transforming the beam c data into suspended particle concentration, and then integrating the particle load to the 1% and 0.1% light depths for each day yields the diel change in the particle load. Apart from changes in scattering and effective cross section, the diel change in the integrated particle load (IPL) represents the cycling of mass into and out of the small particle pool. The daytime increase in the integrated particle load (ΔIPL, defined as the IPL from the evening profile minus the IPL from the morning profile) was converted to carbon units by assuming a 0.4 particulate organic carbon (POC) to particulate matter concentration (PMC) ratio. Our estimate of the net daily POC increase to the 1% light level averaged over the TT008 cruise was 26 mmol C m−2 day−1 (n = 7, SD = 7), and 41 mmol M-2 day 1 (n = 15, SD = 13) for T-012. The integration of the 0.1% light level was 29 mmol m−2 day−1 during TT008, and 41 mmol m−2 day−1 for TT012. As the optical method in situ includes the effects of growth, respiration, mixing, settling, grazing and aggregation, our data are not directly comparable to 14C uptake-based primary production measurements. Rather, the difference between the optical estimates of the change in the particle pool and primary production estimates can be ascribed to removal processes in situ, primarily grazing and aggregation.},

@article{Gardner1995,
	Abstract = {Diel variations in beam attenuation profiles in the upper water column were observed during Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) programs in the North Atlantic (North Atlantic Bloom Experiment-NABE) and Equatorial Pacific (EqPac). Beam attenuation due to particles in surface waters increased during the day by as much as 70% and decreased at night in both studies. In the equatorial Pacific the magnitude of the variations was larger during cool non-El Ni{\~n}o conditions (October, 1992) than during El Ni{\~n}o conditions (March/April 1992). However, the percent increase from the mean beam attenuation value for each time period was similar. The daytime increases result primarily from primary production, with possible contributions from changing optical effects of living cells. Nocturnal decreases in beam attenuation, reflecting particle loss, could be caused by grazing, remineralization, and the production of large particles (aggregates, fecal pellets) with subsequent settling. The nocturnal decreases also were associated with increases in the surface mixed layer depth and increases in nutrient concentrations. Part of these diel changes could result from mixing upward particle-depleted, nutrient-enriched water from below the daytime mixed layer. Since many biological and chemical species have strong gradients in the upper 100 m, regular oscillations in the depth of mixing can be an important forcing function for vertical exchange in surface waters. When it occurs, this ``mixed-layer pump'' is important in sustaining new primary production and in removing particles from surface waters, and should be included in models of oceanic surface mixing.},

@article{Siegel1989,
	Abstract = {Observed diurnal variations of the beam attenuation coefficient at 660 nm (c) are used to estimate variations of particulate concentration and production in the open ocean. The diurnal cycles of c are found to be statistically significant throughout the euphotic zone (the upper 95 m), but not below this depth. Their amplitudes are nearly uniform with respect to depth with characteristic peak to peak values of ∼0.0065 m−1. The minimum (maximum) of these daily variations occurs during local sunrise (sunset), indicating a daytime accumulation of particles. Specific particle production rates (r0) calculated with beam transmissometer data alone have maximum noontime values of ∼0.5 d−1 and are well-correlated with the incident solar radiative flux. The high correlation between the optically determined specific production rates and solar radiation allows r0 to be decomposed into light-dependent and light-independent portions, which are interpreted as particle-specific growth and grazing rates. The resulting specific growth and grazing rates are balanced (i.e. net daily production is approximately zero) and are consistent with previous biological determinations for the open ocean. Daily mean specific growth and grazing rates are found to be ∼0.15 d−1. The value of the water column integrated community production estimated using the optical data is ∼160 mgCm−2 d−1, which compares well with both simultaneous and seasonal mean carbon uptake rate measurements. This optical method should prove useful for in situ observations of particulate production in the oligotrophic ocean.},

@article{Zinser2009,
	Abstract = {The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus MED4 has the smallest genome and cell size of all known photosynthetic organisms. Like all phototrophs at temperate latitudes, it experiences predictable daily variation in available light energy which leads to temporal regulation and partitioning of key cellular processes. To better understand the tempo and choreography of this minimal phototroph, we studied the entire transcriptome of the cell over a simulated daily light-dark cycle, and placed it in the context of diagnostic physiological and cell cycle parameters. All cells in the culture progressed through their cell cycles in synchrony, thus ensuring that our measurements reflected the behavior of individual cells. Ninety percent of the annotated genes were expressed, and 80% had cyclic expression over the diel cycle. For most genes, expression peaked near sunrise or sunset, although more subtle phasing of gene expression was also evident. Periodicities of the transcripts of genes involved in physiological processes such as in cell cycle progression, photosynthesis, and phosphorus metabolism tracked the timing of these activities relative to the light-dark cycle. Furthermore, the transitions between photosynthesis during the day and catabolic consumption of energy reserves at night--- metabolic processes that share some of the same enzymes --- appear to be tightly choreographed at the level of RNA expression. In-depth investigation of these patterns identified potential regulatory proteins involved in balancing these opposing pathways. Finally, while this analysis has not helped resolve how a cell with so little regulatory capacity, and a `deficient' circadian mechanism, aligns its cell cycle and metabolism so tightly to a light-dark cycle, it does provide us with a valuable framework upon which to build when the Prochlorococcus proteome and metabolome become available.},

@article{Stramski1995,
	Abstract = {The optical properties of the oceanic cyanobacterium Synechococcus (clone WH8103) were examined in a nutrient-replete laboratory culture grown under a day-night cycle in natural irradiance. Measurements of the spectral absorption and beam attenuation coefficients, the size distribution of cells in suspension, and microscopic analysis of samples were made at intervals of 2--4 hours for 2 days. These measurements were used to calculate the optical properties at the level of a single ``mean'' cell representative of the actual population, specifically, the optical cross sections for spectral absorption , scattering , and attenuation . In addition, concurrent determinations of chlorophyll a and particulate organic carbon allowed calculation of the Chl a- and C-specific optical coefficients. The refractive index of cells was derived from the observed data using a theory of light absorption and scattering by homogeneous spheres. Low irradiance because of cloudy skies resulted in slow division rates of cells in the culture. The percentage of dividing cells was unusually high (>30\%) throughout the experiment. The optical cross sections varied greatly over a day-night cycle, with a minimum near dawn or midmorning and maximum near dusk. During daylight hours, and can increase more than twofold and by as much as 45\%. The real part of the refractive index n increased during the day; changes in n had equal or greater effect than the varying size distribution on changes in and . The contribution of changes in n to the increase of during daylight hours was 65.7\% and 45.1\% on day 1 and 2, respectively. During the dark period, when decreased by a factor of 2.9, the effect of decreasing n was dominant (86.3\%). With the exception of a few hours during the second light period, the imaginary part of the refractive index n′ showed little variation over a day-night cycle, and was largely controlled by variations in cell size. The real part of the refractive index at λ = 660 nm was correlated with the intracellular C concentration and the imaginary part at λ = 678 nm with the intracellular Chl a concentration. The C-specific attenuation coefficient showed significant diel variability, which has implications for the estimation of oceanic primary production from measurements of diel variability in beam attenuation. This study provides strong evidence that diel variability is an important component of the optical characterization of marine phytoplankton.},

	Abstract = {Diel variations in the optical properties of the marine diatom Thalassiosira p̀seudonana were examined in a nutrient-replete laboratory culture exposed to a day-night cycle in natural irradiance which simulated the light regime in upper layers of the euphotic zone (~10 m). Measurements of the beam attenuation coefficient, absorption coefficient, and size distribution of cells in suspension were used to determine optical cross-sections and refractive index of cells. The optical cross-sections varied greatly over a diel cycle; the absorption cross-section (Xa) increased by as much as 35\% and the attenuation (σ̄c) and scattering (σ̄b) cross-sections by 80\% between minima near sunrise and maxima near sunset. These changes were associated with significant variations in refractive index and cell size. Diel changes in the imaginary part of the refractive index (n'), driven by variation in intracellular pigment concentration, accounted for 58-- 72\% of the difference between the daily maxima and minima in σ̄a. Variations in the real part of the refractive index (n) contributed substantially (up to 85\%) to the daily range in σ̄c and σ̄b. Increases in cell size were important during the morning, increasing the attenuation cross-section to a similar extent as the refractive index. Variability in n correlated strongly with changes in intracellular C concentration. The normalization of attenuation and scattering cross-sections to cellular C content resulted in a threefold reduction in the magnitude of diel variations. If such patterns are general features of planktonic microorganisms in the natural environment, it would suggest that varying particle concentration need not be the only (or even major) factor responsible for diel variability in the bulk optical properties of seawater. As a consequence, estimating particle production rates from diel variability in the beam attenuation coefficient may not be justified in some oceanic situations; however, using this variability to estimate production in terms of particulate organic C may be appropriate.},

	Abstract = {The North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) is one of the largest biomes on Earth. It has a semi-enclosed surface area of about 2 {\texttimes} 107 km2 and mean depth of nearly 5 km and includes a broad range of habitats from warm, light-saturated, nutrient-starved surface waters to the cold, nutrient-rich abyss. Microorganisms are found throughout the water column and are vertically stratified by their genetically determined metabolic capabilities that establish physiological tolerances to temperature, light, pressure, as well as organic and inorganic growth substrates. Despite the global significance of the NPSG for energy and matter transformations and its role in the oceanic carbon cycle, it is grossly undersampled and not well characterized with respect to ecosystem structure and dynamics. Since October 1988, interdisciplinary teams of scientists from the University of Hawaii and around the world have been investigating the NPSG ecosystem at Station ALOHA (A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment), a site chosen to be representative of this expansive oligotrophic habitat, with a focus on microbial processes and biogeochemistry. At the start of this comprehensive field study, the NPSG was thought to be a ``Climax'' community with a relatively stable plankton community structure and relatively low variability in key microbiological rates and processes. Now, after nearly three decades of observations and experimentation we present a new view of this old ocean, one that highlights temporal variability in ecosystem processes across a broad range of scales from diel to decadal and beyond. Our revised paradigm is built on the strength of high-quality time-series observations, on insights from the application of state-of-the-art --omics techniques (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) and, more recently, the discoveries of novel microorganisms and metabolic processes. Collectively, these efforts have led to a new understanding of trophic dynamics and population interactions in the NPSG. A comprehensive understanding of the environmental controls on microbial rates and processes, from genomes to biomes, will be required to inform the scientific community and the public at large about the potential impacts of human-induced climate change. The pace of new discovery, and the importance of integrating this new knowledge into conceptual paradigms and predictive models, is an enormous contemporary challenge with great scientific and societal relevance.},

	Abstract = {The cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is the most abundant photosynthetic organism in the oceans, driving marine food webs and biogeochemistry. Estimates of Prochlorococcus cell mortality and cell production are critical to determine how organic matter is transferred into the food web. Using novel high-resolution sampling methods on two winter-time cruises, we show that the daily production of Prochlorococcus cells in surface waters of the subtropical Pacific gyre is consistently balanced by their nightly consumption by other organisms. These synchronized loss processes suggest that Prochlorococcus-derived organic matter stabilizes multiple species interactions, from viruses to grazers. The observed resilience of this synchronized food web dynamic as temperature increased within the gyre suggests that ecosystem stability may persist in future warmer oceans.Theoretical studies predict that competition for limited resources reduces biodiversity to the point of ecological instability, whereas strong predator/prey interactions enhance the number of coexisting species and limit fluctuations in abundances. In open ocean ecosystems, competition for low availability of essential nutrients results in relatively few abundant microbial species. The remarkable stability in overall cell abundance of the dominant photosynthetic cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is assumed to reflect a simple food web structure strongly controlled by grazers and/or viruses. This hypothesized link between stability and ecological interactions, however, has been difficult to test with open ocean microbes because sampling methods commonly have poor temporal and spatial resolution. Here we use continuous techniques on two different winter-time cruises to show that Prochlorococcus cell production and mortality rates are tightly synchronized to the day/night cycle across the subtropical Pacific Ocean. In warmer waters, we observed harmonic oscillations in cell production and mortality rates, with a peak in mortality rate consistently occurring \~{}6 h after the peak in cell production. Essentially no cell mortality was observed during daylight. Our results are best explained as a synchronized two-component trophic interaction with the per-capita rates of Prochlorococcus consumption driven either directly by the day/night cycle or indirectly by Prochlorococcus cell production. Light-driven synchrony of food web dynamics in which most of the newly produced Prochlorococcus cells are consumed each night likely enforces ecosystem stability across vast expanses of the open ocean.},

@article{Claustre1999,
	Abstract = {The variability in particle attenuation (cp) and in chlorophyll in situ fluorescence (Fis) was examined in November 1994 along 150$\,^{\circ}$W in the Pacific Ocean. Two main sources of variation in cp and Fis profiles are identified by analyzing data from a 16$\,^{\circ}$S--1$\,^{\circ}$N transect, and from two 5 day stations (5$\,^{\circ}$S and 16$\,^{\circ}$S). The first source reflects changes in the trophic status resulting from prevailing hydrodynamical regimes at large scales. By using flow cytometric data and some assumptions about the size distribution of the different biological stocks, a decomposition of cp into its vegetal (cveg) and nonvegetal (cnveg) components is attempted. Within the euphotic layer, cveg accounts for 43\% of the total cp signal at the equator and for only 20\% in the South Pacific gyre. The nonvegetal component is then subdivided into heterotrophic organisms and detritus contributions. The detrital material is an important contributor with 43\% of cp at 5$\,^{\circ}$S and 55\% at 16$\,^{\circ}$S. A further decomposition of Fis and cveg into the three dominant phytoplanktonic groups (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, and picoeucaryotes) confirms that picoeucaryotes are important contributors of the vegetal biomass, especially within and below the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) (>50\% of the algal stock) at 16$\,^{\circ}$S. The second, and essentially local, source of variation is related to specific rhythms in biological and physiological processes. The prominent signals detected during the time series occur at the daily scale: besides the pronounced fluorescence depression at noon in upper layers, particle attenuation in all the layers examined and fluorescence in the DCM display conspicuous daily oscillations. They result from the balance between daytime accumulation and night removal of particles, of algal cells in particular. Finally, the estimation of cp-based growth rates points out the surprisingly rapid turnover time of the whole particulate matter stock in oligotrophic waters (16$\,^{\circ}$S), not only in the euphotic zone (0.63 d−1) but also within the dimly lit layers of the DCM (0.36 d−1). The corresponding growth rate at 5$\,^{\circ}$S, within a quasi-mesotrophic regime, is 0.47 d−1 within the euphotic zone.},

@article{Claustre2002,
	Abstract = {Prochlorococcus is an important component of phototrophic biomass in oligotrophic areas. In such systems, diel variations in optical properties have been reported. In order to better understand these natural variations, the optical (absorption, attenuation, and scattering) and biochemical (carbon and pigment) properties of an axenic clone of Prochlorococcus, PCC 9511, grown in a turbidostat set under light conditions that simulated those found near the ocean surface, were monitored every 2 h for several consecutive days. All optical parameters showed pronounced diel patterns except the divinyl-chlorophyll a (Dv-Chl a) specific absorption coefficient at 676 nm, a*(676), which remained stable (0.019 m2 mg Dv-Chl a21). The diel oscillations of the Dv-Chl a specific absorption coefficient at 440 nm, a*(440) (43\% increase between sunrise and sunset), were essentially governed by variations in the zeaxanthin to Dv-Chl a ratio (52\% increase of this ratio between sunrise and sunset). The scattering cross section at 555 nm, σb(555), showed oscillations with the largest amplitude (182\% increase between sunrise and sunset). Finally, the carbon-specific attenuation coefficient at 660 nm, cc*(660) (1.04 m2 gC−1) is less than half that of the other algal groups. This estimation, together with the diel fluctuations in cc*(660) highlighted in the present study, is discussed in the context of using in situ measurements of optical properties to infer biogeochemical stocks (vegetal or detrital biomass) or processes (primary production).},

@article{EversKing2017_POCunc,
	Abstract = {Particulate Organic Carbon (POC) plays a vital role in the ocean carbon cycle. Though relatively small compared with other carbon pools, the POC pool is responsible for large fluxes and is linked to many important ocean biogeochemical processes. The satellite ocean-colour signal is influenced by particle composition, size, and concentration and provides a way to observe variability in the POC pool at a range of temporal and spatial scales. To provide accurate estimates of POC concentration from satellite ocean colour data requires algorithms that are well validated, with uncertainties characterised. Here, a number of algorithms to derive POC using different optical variables are applied to merged satellite ocean colour data provided by the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) and validated against the largest database of $\textit{in situ}$ POC measurements currently available. The results of this validation exercise indicate satisfactory levels of performance from several algorithms (highest performance was observed from the algorithms of \cite{stramski2008} and \cite{loisel2002}) and uncertainties that are within the requirements of the user community. Estimates of the standing stock of the POC can be made by applying these algorithms, and yield an estimated mixed-layer integrated global stock of POC between 0.77 and 1.3 Pg C of carbon. Performance of the algorithms vary regionally, suggesting that blending of region-specific algorithms may provide the best way forward for generating global POC products.},

@article{Kim_2018,
	Abstract = { AbstractAs internal waves (IWs) are generated via internal tidal energy near the bottom shelf break of the Korea Strait, continuous evolutions of IWs are extremely difficult to observe using satellite observations. However, the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) has enabled the detection of IWs in the East/Japan Sea (EJS) on an hourly basis to investigate their propagation behavior. For an extended IW analysis, a total of seven packets were identified using GOCI chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) measurements around the Ulleung Basin and Dok Island in the EJS. The results demonstrate that the IW locations had lower Chl-a values than non-IW-affected regions on 10, 11, 13, and 14 August 2013. The lower Chl-a values are due to the significant wave heights of the IWs, which cause surface water masses to be dispersed. In addition, from the continuous trajectories of the waves in the hourly GOCI Chl-a imagery, quantitative physical parameters of the IWs, such as their pathway (northeasterly), phase speed (1.46--1.61 m s−1), amplitude (20.62--26.76 m), and period (12.29 h), could be obtained. Therefore, the advantage of using GOCI is the ability to detect and analyze the physical characteristics of IWs on an hourly time scale. },

Beginning 1 October 2013, the JPSS baseline consists of a suite of five instruments: advanced microwave and infrared sounders critical for short- and medium-range weather forecasting; an advanced visible and infrared imager needed for environmental assessments such as snow/ice cover, droughts, volcanic ash, forest fires and surface temperature; ozone sensor primarily used for global monitoring of ozone and input to weather and climate models; and an Earth radiation budget sensor for monitoring the Earth's energy budget. NASA will fund the Earth radiation budget sensor and the ozone limb sensor for the second JPSS operational satellite---JPSS-2. JPSS is implemented through a partnership between NOAA and the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NOAA is responsible for overall funding; maintaining the high-level requirements; establishing international and interagency partnerships; developing the science and algorithms, and user engagement; NOAA also provides product data distribution and archiving of JPSS data. NASA's role is to serve as acquisition Center of Excellence, providing acquisition of instruments, spacecraft and the multimission ground system, and early mission implementation through turnover to NOAA for operations.},

@article{Signorini_2015,
	Abstract = {A 16-year (1998-2013) analysis of trends and seasonal patterns was conducted for the five subtropical ocean gyres using satellite data: chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) retrievals from ocean color, sea surface temperature (SST), and sea-level anomaly (SLA).  Trend analysis was also performed on mixed-layer data derived from ocean model gridded temperature and salinity profiles (1998-2010). The Chl-a monthly composites were constructed from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua using two different algorithms: the standard algorithm (STD) that has been in use since the start of the SeaWiFS mission in 1997, and a more recently developed Ocean Color Index (OCI) algorithm with improved accuracy in low Chl-a waters. 
Trends were obtained for all gyres using both STD and OCI algorithms, which demonstrated generally consistent results.  The North Pacific, Indian Ocean, North Atlantic and South Atlantic gyres showed significant downward trends in Chl-a, while the South Pacific gyre has a much weaker upward trend with no statistical significance. Time series of satellite-derived net primary production (NPP) showed downward trends for all the gyres, while all five gyres exhibited positive trends in SST and SLA. 
The seasonal variability of Chl-a in each gyre is tightly coupled to the variability in mixed layer depth (MLD) with peak values in winter in both hemispheres when vertical mixing is more vigorous,  reaching depths approaching the nutricline. On a seasonal basis, Chl-a concentrations increase when the MLD approaches or is deeper than the nutricline depth, in agreement with the concept that vertical mixing is the major driving mechanism for phytoplankton photosynthesis in the interior of the gyres. The combination of surface warming trends and biomass reduction over the 16-year period has the potential to reduce atmospheric CO2 uptake by the gyres and therefore influence the global carbon cycle.},

	Abstract = {The primary goals of the Sea‐Viewing Wide Field‐of‐View Sensor (SeaWiFS) are to routinely provide the global ocean color and ocean bio‐optical property data. In retrieving the ocean near‐surface signals from SeaWiFS‐measured radiances, however, the aerosol effects must be accurately estimated and removed. Therefore SeaWiFS also produces the aerosol optical property data (in particular, the aerosol optical thickness and {\AA}ngstr{\"o}m exponent) over global ocean. Since September of 1997, SeaWiFS has generated both global aerosol (over ocean) and ocean color data for more than 6.5 years and is still in producing these products with very good sensor performance. This makes SeaWiFS the longest in history for providing simultaneously the global aerosol and ocean color products. In this paper we describe the SeaWiFS aerosol products over ocean in combination with the ocean color data. We assert through various examples that, because SeaWiFS simultaneously retrieves both atmospheric and ocean color data, the SeaWiFS products are useful to study aerosol and ocean variations in climatic forcing, biogeochemical cycling, and radiative effects in the global and regional scales.},

	Abstract = {Performance assessment of ocean color satellite data has generally relied on statistical metrics chosen for their common usage and the rationale for selecting certain metrics is infrequently explained. Commonly reported statistics based on mean squared errors, such as the coefficient of determination (r2), root mean square error, and regression slopes, are most appropriate for Gaussian distributions without outliers and, therefore, are often not ideal for ocean color algorithm performance assessment, which is often limited by sample availability. In contrast, metrics based on simple deviations, such as bias and mean absolute error, as well as pair-wise comparisons, often provide more robust and straightforward quantities for evaluating ocean color algorithms with non-Gaussian distributions and outliers. This study uses a SeaWiFS chlorophyll-a validation data set to demonstrate a framework for satellite data product assessment and recommends a multi-metric and user-dependent approach that can be applied within science, modeling, and resource management communities.},

	Abstract = {The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) is the world's first ocean color sensor in geostationary orbit. Although the GOCI has shown excellent radiometric performance with little long-term radiometric degradation and a high signal-to-noise ratio, there are radiometric artefacts in GOCI Level 1 products caused by stray light detected within the GOCI optics. To correct the radiometric bias, we developed an image-based correction algorithm called the correction of the interslot discrepancy using the minimum noise fraction transform (CIDUM) in a previous study and evaluated its performance with respect to the physical radiometric quantity stored in Level 1 products, i.e., top-of-atmosphere radiance. This study evaluated the performance of the CIDUM algorithm in terms of remote sensing reflectance, which is one of the most important products in ocean color remote sensing. The resultant CIDUM-corrected remote sensing reflectance products were validated using both relative (within the image) and absolute references (in situ measurements). Image validation showed that CIDUM corrected the bias in remote sensing reflectance (up to 20%) and reduced the bias to ≤5% in the tested image. In situ validation showed that relative uncertainty was reduced by around 10% within the visible bands and the correlation between the in situ and GOCI radiometric data was enhanced.},

	Abstract = {The first geostationary ocean color satellite sensor, Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), which is onboard South Korean Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS), was successfully launched in June of 2010. GOCI has a local area coverage of the western Pacific region centered at around 36{\textdegree}N and 130{\textdegree}E and covers ~2500 {\texttimes} 2500 km2. GOCI has eight spectral bands from 412 to 865 nm with an hourly measurement during daytime from 9:00 to 16:00 local time, i.e., eight images per day. In a collaboration between NOAA Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR) and Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (KIOST), we have been working on deriving and improving GOCI ocean color products, e.g., normalized water-leaving radiance spectra (nLw($\lambda$)), chlorophyll-a concentration, diffuse attenuation coefficient at the wavelength of 490 nm (Kd(490)), etc. The GOCI-covered ocean region includes one of the world's most turbid and optically complex waters. To improve the GOCI-derived nLw($\lambda$) spectra, a new atmospheric correction algorithm was developed and implemented in the GOCI ocean color data processing. The new algorithm was developed specifically for GOCI-like ocean color data processing for this highly turbid western Pacific region. In this paper, we show GOCI ocean color results from our collaboration effort. From in situ validation analyses, ocean color products derived from the new GOCI ocean color data processing have been significantly improved. Generally, the new GOCI ocean color products have a comparable data quality as those from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the satellite Aqua. We show that GOCI-derived ocean color data can provide an effective tool to monitor ocean phenomenon in the region such as tide-induced re-suspension of sediments, diurnal variation of ocean optical and biogeochemical properties, and horizontal advection of river discharge. In particular, we show some examples of ocean diurnal variations in the region, which can be provided effectively from satellite geostationary measurements.},

	Abstract = {Measurements of ocean color from Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) with a moderate spatial resolution and a high temporal frequency demonstrate high value for a number of oceanographic applications. This study aims to propose and evaluate the calibration of GOCI as needed to achieve the level of radiometric accuracy desired for ocean color studies. Previous studies reported that the GOCI retrievals of normalized water-leaving radiances (nLw) are biased high for all visible bands due to the lack of vicarious calibration. The vicarious calibration approach described here relies on the assumed constant aerosol characteristics over the open-ocean sites to accurately estimate atmospheric radiances for the two near-infrared (NIR) bands. The vicarious calibration of visible bands is performed using in situ nLw measurements and the satellite-estimated atmospheric radiance using two NIR bands over the case-1 waters. Prior to this analysis, the in situ nLw spectra in the NIR are corrected by the spectrum optimization technique based on the NIR similarity spectrum assumption. The vicarious calibration gain factors derived for all GOCI bands (except 865nm) significantly improve agreement in retrieved remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) relative to in situ measurements. These gain factors are independent of angular geometry and possible temporal variability. To further increase the confidence in the calibration gain factors, a large data set from shipboard measurements and AERONET-OC is used in the validation process. It is shown that the absolute percentage difference of the atmospheric correction results from the vicariously calibrated GOCI system is reduced by ~6.8\%.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in global biogeochemical research demonstrate a critical need for long-term ocean color satellite data records of consistent high quality. To achieve that quality, spaceborne instruments require on-orbit vicarious calibration, where the integrated instrument and atmospheric correction system is adjusted using in situ normalized water-leaving radiances, such as those collected by the marine optical buoy (MOBY). Unfortunately, well-characterized time-series of in situ data are scarce for many historical satellite missions, in particular, the NASA coastal zone color scanner (CZCS) and the ocean color and temperature scanner (OCTS). Ocean surface reflectance models (ORMs)accurately reproduce spectra observed in clear marine waters, using only chlorophylla (Ca) as input, a measurement for which long-term in situ time series exist. Before recalibrating CZCS and OCTS using modeled radiances, however, we evaluate the approach with the Sea-viewing Wide-Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). Using annualCa climatologies as input into an ORM, we derive SeaWiFS vicarious gains that differ from the operational MOBY gains by less than$+$/-0.9\% spectrally. In the context of generating decadalCa climate data records, we quantify the downstream effects of using these modeled gains by generating satellite-to-in situ data product validation statistics for comparison with the operational SeaWiFS results. Finally, we apply these methods to the CZCS and OCTS ocean color time series.},

The approach developed by the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG) adjusts the integrated instrument and atmospheric correction system to retrieve normalized water-leaving radiances that are in agreement with ground truth measurements.The method is independent of the satellite sensor or the source of the ground truth data, but it is specific to the atmospheric correction algorithm.The OBPG vicarious calibration approach is described in detail, and results are presented for the operational calibration of SeaWiFS using data from the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) and observations of clear-water sites in the South Pacific and southern Indian Ocean. It is shown that the vicarious calibration allows SeaWiFS to reproduce the MOBY radiances and achieve good agreement with radiometric and chlorophyll a measurements from independent in situ sources. We also find that the derived vicarious gains show no significant temporal or geometric dependencies, and that the mission-average calibration reaches stability after$\sim$20-40high-quality calibration samples. Finally, we demonstrate that the performance of the vicariously calibrated retrieval system is relatively insensitive to the assumptions inherent in our approach.},

	Abstract = { Abstract The ocean color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC) has been implemented to support long-term satellite ocean color investigations through cross-site consistent and accurate measurements collected by autonomous radiometer systems deployed on offshore fixed platforms. The AERONET-OC data products are the normalized water-leaving radiances determined at various center wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. These data complement atmospheric AERONET aerosol products, such as optical thickness, size distribution, single scattering albedo, and phase function. This work describes in detail this new AERONET component and its specific elements including measurement method, instrument calibration, processing scheme, quality assurance, uncertainties, data archive, and products accessibility. Additionally, the atmospheric and bio-optical features of the sites currently included in AERONET-OC are briefly summarized. After illustrating the application of AERONET-OC data to the validation of primary satellite products over a variety of complex coastal waters, recommendations are then provided for the identification of new deployment sites most suitable to support satellite ocean color missions. },

	Abstract = {We describe the development of a new suite of aerosol models for the retrieval of atmospheric and oceanic optical properties from the SeaWiFS and MODIS sensors, including aerosol optical thickness ($\tau$), angstrom coefficient ($\alpha$), and water-leaving radiance (Lw). The new aerosol models are derived from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations and have bimodal lognormal distributions that are narrower than previous models used by the Ocean Biology Processing Group. We analyzed AERONET data over open ocean and coastal regions and found that the seasonal variability in the modal radii, particularly in the coastal region, was related to the relative humidity. These findings were incorporated into the models by making the modal radii, as well as the refractive indices, explicitly dependent on relative humidity. From these findings, we constructed a new suite of aerosol models. We considered eight relative humidity values (30\%, 50\%, 70\%, 75\%, 80\%, 85\%, 90\%, and 95\%) and, for each relative humidity value, we constructed ten distributions by varying the fine-mode fraction from zero to 1. In all, 80 distributions (8 Rh{\texttimes}10 fine-mode fractions) were created to process the satellite data. We also assumed that the coarse-mode particles were nonabsorbing (sea salt) and that all observed absorptions were entirely due to fine-mode particles. The composition of the fine mode was varied to ensure that the new models exhibited the same spectral dependence of single scattering albedo as observed in the AERONET data. The reprocessing of the SeaWiFS data show that, over deep ocean, the average $\tau$865 values retrieved from the new aerosol models was 0.100{\textpm}0.004, which was closer to the average AERONET value of 0.086{\textpm}0.066 for $\tau$870 for the eight open-ocean sites used in this study. The average $\tau$865 value from the old models was 0.131{\textpm}0.005. The comparison of monthly mean aerosol optical thickness retrieved from the SeaWiFS sensor with AERONET data over Bermuda and Wallops Island show very good agreement with one another. In fact, 81\% of the data points over Bermuda and 78\% of the data points over Wallops Island fall within an uncertainty of {\textpm}0.02 in optical thickness. As a part of the reprocessing effort of the SeaWiFS data, we also revised the vicarious calibration gain factors, which resulted in significant improvement in angstrom coefficient ($\alpha$) retrievals. The average value of $\alpha$ from the new models over Bermuda is 0.841{\textpm}0.171, which is in good agreement with the AERONET value of 0.891{\textpm}0.211. The average value of $\alpha$ retrieved using old models is 0.394{\textpm}0.087, which is significantly lower than the AERONET value.},

@article{Gordon1994,
	Abstract = {The second generation of ocean-color-analyzing instruments requires more accurate atmospheric correction than does the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), if one is to utilize fully their increased radiometric sensitivity. Unlike the CZCS, the new instruments possess bands in the near infrared (NIR) that are solely for aiding atmospheric correction. We show, using aerosol models, that certain assumptions regarding the spectral behavior of the aerosol reflectance employed in the standard CZCS correction algorithm are not valid over the spectral range encompassing both the visible and the NIR. Furthermore, we show that multiple-scattering effects on the algorithm depend significantly on the aerosol model. Following these observations, we propose an algorithm that utilizes the NIR bands for atmospheric correction to the required accuracy. Examples of the dependence of the error on the aerosol model, the turbidity of the atmosphere, and surface roughness (waves) are provided. The error in the retrieved phytoplankton-pigment concentration (the principal product of ocean-color sensors) induced by errors in the atmospheric correction are shown to be \&lt;20\% in approximately 90\% of the cases examined. Finally, the aerosol thickness ($\tau$a) is estimated through a simple extension of the correction algorithm. Simulations suggest that the error in the recovered value of $\tau$a should be ? 10\%.},

	Abstract = {The atmospheric correction algorithm employed by the NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group requires an assumption of negligible water-leaving reflectance in the near-infrared region of the spectrum. For waters where this assumption is not valid, an optical model is used to estimate near-infrared water-leaving reflectance. We describe this optical model as implemented for the sixth reprocessing of the SeaWiFS mission-long time-series (September 2009). Application of the optical model resulted in significant reductions in the number of negative water-leaving reflectance retrievals in turbid and optically complex waters, and improved agreement with in situ chlorophyll-a observations. The incidence of negative water-leaving reflectance retrievals at 412 nm was reduced by 40\%, while negative reflectance at 490 nm was nearly eliminated.},

	Abstract = {This study assesses the performance of the Geostationary Ocean Imager (GOCI) for mapping of suspended particulate matter in the Bohai Sea, a turbid water region. GOCI imagery for remote sensing reflectance and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) is analysed in detail for two days in June 2011 (8 images per day). Both instantaneous and daily composite maps are considered and a comparison is made with corresponding reflectance and TSS products from MODIS-AQUA. Results show TSS distributions corresponding to previous studies of the region. The advantage of the higher acquisition frequency (8 images/day instead of 1) offered by GOCI is clearly demonstrated in the daily composite which is more complete during this period of scattered but moving clouds. Consideration of temporal variation over the day indicates low natural variability but some artificial variability from processing errors --- this analysis provides a first indication of how the higher frequency of data from geostationary ocean colour could lead to improved data quality control via temporal coherency outlier detection. While there is room for improvement on the GOCI calibration, atmospheric correction and retrieval algorithms, the current study suggests that the GOCI data can already be used now to study qualitatively sediment dynamics except in the extremely turbid waters which are masked out of the current dataset. In a wider context, it is considered that the technical challenges of geostationary ocean colour have been met by the GOCI concept, and, notwithstanding potential improvements on the concept and data processing methods, it is recommended that this mission serve as a model for future geostationary ocean colour sensors over Europe/Africa and the Americas.},

SEVIRI lacks sufficient bands for chlorophyll remote sensing but its spectral resolution is sufficient for quantification of Total Suspended Matter (TSM) in turbid waters, using a single broad red band, combined with a suitable near infrared band. A test data set for mapping of TSM in the Southern North Sea was obtained covering 35 consecutive days from June 28 until July 31 2006. Atmospheric correction of SEVIRI images includes corrections for Rayleigh and aerosol scattering, absorption by atmospheric gases and atmospheric transmittances. The aerosol correction uses assumptions on the ratio of marine reflectances and aerosol reflectances in the red and near-infrared bands. A single band TSM retrieval algorithm, calibrated by nonlinear regression of seaborne measurements of TSM and marine reflectance was applied. The effect of the above assumptions on the uncertainty of the marine reflectance and TSM products was analysed. Results show that (1) mapping of TSM in the Southern North Sea is feasible with SEVIRI for turbid waters, though with considerable uncertainties in clearer waters, (2) TSM maps are well correlated with TSM maps obtained from MODIS AQUA and (3) during cloud-free days, high frequency dynamics of TSM are detected.},

	Abstract = {Monitoring front dynamics is essential for studying the ocean's physical and biogeochemical processes. However, the diurnal displacement of fronts remains unclear because of limited in situ observations. Using the hourly satellite imageries from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) with a spatial resolution of 500 m, we investigated the diurnal displacement of turbidity fronts in both the northern Jiangsu shoal water (NJSW) and the southwestern Korean coastal water (SKCW) in the Yellow Sea (YS). The hourly turbidity fronts were retrieved from the GOCI-derived total suspended matter using the entropy-based algorithm. The results showed that the entropy-based algorithm could provide fine structure and clearly temporal evolution of turbidity fronts. Moreover, the diurnal displacement of turbidity fronts in NJSW can be up to 10.3 km in response to the onshore-offshore movements of tidal currents, much larger than it is in SKCW (around 4.7 km). The discrepancy between NJSW and SKCW are mainly caused by tidal current direction relative to the coastlines. Our results revealed the significant diurnal displacement of turbidity fronts, and highlighted the feasibility of using geostationary ocean color remote sensing technique to monitor the short-term frontal variability, which may contribute to understanding of the sediment dynamics and the coupling physical-biogeochemical processes.},
