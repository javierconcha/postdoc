% Background/motivation/context
% Aim/objectives(s)/problem statement
A key on-orbit calibration step for satellite remote sensing of ocean color is the vicarious calibration.
This establishes the final gains for each spectral band on the sensor that minimize bias in the retrieved ocean color signal.
The vicarious calibration is specific to the instrument and the atmospheric correction algorithm.
% Methods
The vicarious calibration gains for the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) are presented here, which were derived to optimize the performance of NASA's standard atmospheric correction algorithm as implemented in the l2gen code and distributed through the SeaDAS open-source software package.
Following NASA's protocols, the near infrared (NIR) bands were calibrated first, and the visible bands were then calibrated relative to this fixed NIR calibration.
The gain for the 745-nm NIR band was derived using a fixed aerosol model, which was chosen based on the Angstrom Coefficients derived from MODIS on Aqua (MODISA). 
For the vicarious gains of the visible bands, two sources for the target water-leaving radiances were tested: matchups from MODISA and climatological data from SeaWiFS. 
A validation analysis using AERONET-OC data shows an improvement in sensor performance when compared with results using the current vicarious gains and results using no vicarious calibration. 
% Results
Good agreement was found in vicarious gains derived using both concurrent MODISA and climatological SeaWiFS as vicarious calibration data sources.  
% Conclusions
These results support the use of a concurrent sensor for the vicarious calibration when {\it in situ} data are not available, and demonstrate that using climatology from a well-calibrated sensor like SeaWiFS for the vicarious calibration is a valid alternative when it is not possible to use a concurrent sensor or {\it in situ} data. 
We recommend using the gains derived from concurrent GOCI matchups with MODISA for GOCI processing in SeaDAS/l2gen.

\section{Introduction}
% vcal importance within the big picture
Satellite Ocean Color (OC) sensors enable studies of the biogeochemical processes within the Earth's marine biosphere by measuring the interaction of sunlight with the optically-active constituents in the upper ocean euphotic zone. These satellite measurements can then be related to environmental properties such as suspended sediment loads or concentrations of the phytoplankton pigment chlorophyll-a, a proxy for phytoplankton abundance that is related to marine primary productivity. A significant challenge in the measurement of ocean color is to accurately account for the effects of the atmosphere on both the sunlight that reaches the ocean and the return signal from the ocean that emanates back through the atmosphere to the satellite sensor.  Even though calibration efforts before launch and on-orbit (e.g., lunar and solar calibration) are key for obtaining accurate estimates of the ocean color signal, they do not ensure optimal retrieval performance because systematic bias caused by the atmospheric correction algorithm and residual error in instrument calibration are not taken into account. In order to obtain well-calibrated satellite data, an additional on-orbit calibration known as vicarious calibration needs to be applied. The vicarious calibration is able to adjust the system performance by updating the pre-launch and post-launch instrument gains \citep{Franz:07}. This process ensures the accuracy needed to retrieve the rather small water-leaving signal, which constitutes at most 10\% of the total signal reaching the sensor. 

% GOCI
Geostationary (GEO) OC sensors have the advantage of capturing short-term (hours) changes in ocean properties. The high frequency data from GEO OC enables studies on sub-diurnal processes including primary productivity, tidal variability, and formation and dissipation of phytoplankton blooms \citep{Ruddick2014}. The first, and only, geostationary satellite dedicated to Ocean Color, the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) \citep{Ryu2012}, was launched in 2010 by the Republic of Korea. It monitors the Northeast Asian waters surrounding the Korean peninsula, capturing eight (hourly) images per day with a spatial resolution of 500 m, in eight spectral bands (6 in the visible (VIS): 412, 443, 490, 555, 660 and 680 nm; and 2 in the NIR: 745 and 865 nm).  Utilization of GOCI (or future GEO OC sensors) to detect changes in ocean constituents at sub-diurnal to multi-day time scales requires well-calibrated and atmospherically corrected water-leaving radiances that are inherently consistent. 

% NASA capabilities
The Ocean Biology Distributed Active Archive Center (OB.DAAC) at the NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, maintained by the Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG), acts as a mirror-server for the GOCI data, which is provided by the Korea Ocean Satellite Center.  To support the visualization and processing of these data, the OB.DAAC distributes the SeaDAS software package.  SeaDAS includes the multi-sensor Level-1 to Level-2 generator (l2gen), which has the capability of applying the standard NASA atmospheric correction algorithm to the GOCI data. The l2gen code also includes tools to perform vicarious calibration (described in more details in the Appendix B in the supplemental material). 

% summary
Although the vicarious calibration method is independent of the satellite sensor or the source of the target data, it is specific to the atmospheric correction algorithm \citep{Franz:07}. Vicarious calibration for GOCI has been performed for different atmospheric correction approaches \citep{Ahn2015,Wang:13}. The primary objective of this work is to provide a vicarious calibration for GOCI specific to the atmospheric correction algorithm used by NASA. The gain for the shortest NIR band ($\text{NIR}_\text{S}$) is calculated using an aerosol model based on the Angstrom coefficients retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on the Aqua satellite (MODISA) \citep{Esaias1998}. Then, two different approaches for deriving the gains in the visible bands are evaluated: one based on contemporaneous MODISA data and one based on climatological data from SeaWiFS. The results are validated with data from the AErosol RObotic NETwork-Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) \citep{Zibordi2009} and compared with heritage OC missions. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% SECTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Approach}
% vcal definition
The goal of the vicarious calibration is to minimize the difference between remotely sensed water-leaving radiance retrievals and the expected (real) water-leaving radiance. The vicarious calibration adopted here is based on the standard method used for calibrating polar-orbiting OC sensors \citep{Franz:07}. Briefly, the vicarious calibration consists in applying multiplicative correction factors or gains to the total top of the atmosphere (TOA) retrieved signal (TOA radiance signal or $L_\text{t}$) forcing the retrieved water-leaving signal (water-leaving radiance or $L_\text{w}$) to match the target (or expected) water-leaving signal (${L_\text{w}}^\text{t}$). Then, the gains for the observation sample $i^{th}$, $g_i$, are calculated as \cite{Franz:07}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:g_i}
  g_i={L_\text{t}}^\text{t}/L_\text{t}
\end{equation}
where ${L_\text{t}}^\text{t}$ is the target total TOA radiance and $L_\text{t}$ is the observed total TOA radiance (satellite data), defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:L_t}
  L_\text{t}=[L_\text{r}+L_\text{a}+t_{\text{d}_\text{v}}(L_\text{f}+L_\text{w})]t_{\text{g}_\text{v}}t_{\text{g}_\text{s}}f_\text{p}
\end{equation}
where $L_\text{w}$ is the water-leaving radiance, which is the quantity of interest. The terms $L_\text{r}$, $L_\text{a}$, and $L_\text{f}$ in Eq. (\ref{eq:L_t}) are the contributions from air molecules, aerosols, and white-caps or sea foam respectively. The term $t_{\text{d}_\text{v}}$ is the diffuse transmittance along the surface-sensor, and $t_{\text{g}_\text{v}}$ and $t_{\text{g}_\text{s}}$  are the transmittance accounting for the losses due to gaseous absorption in the sun-surface and surface-sensor radiant paths, respectively. The term $f_\text{p}$ is a polarization correction factor. All terms in Eq. (\ref{eq:g_i}) and Eq. (\ref{eq:L_t}) are spectrally dependent, but this dependency was omitted for brevity.

The target values could be based on {\it in situ } data, modeled data, regional climatologies or retrievals from another sensor. In practice this process is divided in two steps. First, the NIR bands are calibrated, and then the visible bands are calibrated using these calibrated NIR bands.  Here, both steps utilize satellite data over the same calibration site: GOCI Clear Water Subset (GCWS) (Fig. \ref{fig:GOCI_map}). The GCWS was used as the calibration site because it is an oligotrophic deep-water ocean region where spatial variability of in-water optical properties is minimized, and it is far from land and active volcanic islands, such that the dominant aerosols can be assumed to result from purely marine processes \citep{Franz:07}. The GCWS was also carefully defined to avoid slot-edge distortion inherent to the GOCI image acquisition system \citep{Kim:2015,Kim:2016}, and to avoid differences in acquisition time between the slots.

\subsection{Calibration of the Near-Infrared Bands}
\label{sec:vcal_nir}
% vcal_opt:

The main unknown in the vicarious calibration analysis is the aerosol contribution, and a series of assumptions are made to determine this contribution. One assumption is that the instrument calibration of the longest NIR wavelength ($\text{NIR}_\text{L}$) is perfect, and therefore, the vicarious gain for this band is unity (i.e. $g_i(\text{NIR}_\text{L})=1$). The other assumption is that the water contribution in the NIR spectral regime over a predominantly oligotrophic region is equal to zero (i.e. $L_\text{wn}(\text{NIR}_\text{S})=0$ and $L_\text{wn}(\text{NIR}_\text{L})=0$, with $\text{NIR}_\text{L}$ the longest NIR wavelength). The ${L_\text{a}}^\text{t}(\text{NIR}_\text{L})$ can be determined directly from the satellite observations using these two assumptions. Finally, if the aerosol type is known, the aerosol model associated with this known aerosol type, in combination with the retrieved ${L_\text{a}}^\text{t}(\text{NIR}_\text{L})$, are used to predict the aerosol contribution in the shorter NIR band (${L_\text{a}}^\text{t}(\text{NIR}_\text{S})$) \citep{Franz:07}. 

When processing satellite data using the l2gen algorithm, the aerosol type (aerosol model) used for determining the aerosol contribution is chosen based on the relative humidity (RH). In practice, the aerosol model can be determined based on the typical value of Angstrom coefficient over the calibration site. The l2gen algorithm in calibration mode has the capability to run with a target Angstrom coefficient, allowing the relative RH to be determined internally based on this target value, and posteriorly perform the aerosol model selection \citep{Ahmad2010,Mobley2016}. For this study, a mean Angstrom coefficient of $0.9$ was obtained from MODISA measurements over the GCWS region, with a similar Angstrom coefficient obtained from SeaWiFS data (see Appendix A in the supplemental material for more details).

A set of vicarious gains for the GOCI's $\text{NIR}_\text{S}$ band $g_i(\text{NIR}_\text{S}$) are calculated by processing the GOCI images using the l2gen code in calibration mode with a target Angstrom coefficient of $0.9$, and over the calibration site (GCWS region). Exclusion criteria based on \cite{Bailey2006} were applied to the $g_i$ values, with only those values that passed the exclusion criteria considered. The mission mean vicarious gain for the $\text{NIR}_\text{S}$ band $\bar{g}(745)$ (Fig. \ref{fig:GOCI_map}, \autoref{tab:vcal_gains_comp}) was calculated as the temporal average using the mean of the semi-interquartile range (MSIQR) to minimize the effect of spurious outliers, as suggested by \cite{Franz:07}. The calculated vicarious gain for GOCI's 745 nm band was found to be 0.9492. A more detailed explanation focusing on the tools and exclusion criteria used to calculate the Angstrom Coefficient and the vicarious gain for the 745 nm band of GOCI is described in Appendix B in the supplemental material. Now, with the vicarious gain for the NIR bands, $\bar{g}(865)=1.0$ and $\bar{g}(745)=0.9492$, the atmospheric correction algorithm can be used to determine the aerosol contribution for the remainder of the visible wavelength bands, and consequently, their vicarious gains.

\subsection{Calibration of the Visible Bands}
\label{sec:vcal_vis}
% - VIS gain: run GOCI with SeaWiFS and AQUA nLw target to determine VIS gain
In this step, the target normalized water-leaving radiances ${L_\text{wn}}^\text{t}$ need to be determined first in order to retrieve the  ${L_\text{t}}^\text{t}$ later and be able to calculate the vicarious gain $g_i$ (Eq. (\ref{eq:g_i})). First, the aerosol properties (${L_\text{a}}^\text{t}$) are retrieved using the NASA standard algorithm \citep{Mobley2016} and the vicariously calibrated NIR bands. Then, the ${L_\text{wn}}^\text{t}$ and the ${L_\text{a}}^\text{t}$ along with the atmospheric correction algorithm in inverse mode are used to calculate ${L_\text{t}}^\text{t}$ \citep{Franz:07}, and a set of $g_i$ values are derived for each $L_t$-${L_\text{wn}}^\text{t}$ pair. An exclusion criteria similar to \cite{Bailey2006} is applied to each $g_i$ value. Finally, this set of $g_i$ are aggregated via the MISQR to derive the mission-average vicarious gain, $\bar{g}$, for each visible wavelength. A more detailed description of this process and the exclusion criteria is described in Appendix C in the supplemental material. In this work, two sources of ${L_\text{wn}}^\text{t}$ are explored: retrievals from the MODISA sensor and a climatology derived from the sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) \citep{McClain2004}.

\subsubsection{${L_\text{wn}}^\text{t}$ derived from MODISA}
  % Apply MODISA to accomplish vicarious calibration of GOCI from 2011 through 2015 (or until you have sufficient data points for stable vicarious gains; Bryan does this sound reasonable?) to avoid the recent couple of years where MODIS-A data is more suspect.  This approach would be more similar to using MOBY as described in Franz {\it et} al. 2007.  Here you would apply daily mean MODIS Rrs for the GCW that pass through your exclusion criteria rather than MOBY to accomplish the vicarious calibration of GOCI. You can then use VIIRS and AERONET-OC as independent comparisons (validation) of the GOCI Rrs.  You can still show the GOCI comparisons with MODIS-A and VIIRS, just have to indicate that the comparison with MODIS-A is not independent.  Since you already have MODIS data processed, this will be quicker, but I think it’s worth looking at using SeaWiFS too.

MODISA data were used to generate targeted values (i.e. ${L_\text{wn}}^\text{t}$) for the vicarious calibration of GOCI's visible bands. The calibration was made with the GOCI image closest in time to the MODISA image, and always within a 30-minute time window. Also, the MODISA 547 nm band with a band shift to 555 nm was used to calibrate the GOCI 555 nm band using the function "conv\_rrs\_to\_555" from the l2gen code. In practice, the gains were obtained by processing the GOCI-MODISA matchups using the l2gen code in calibration (inverse) mode with these MODISA-derived ${L_\text{wn}}^\text{t}$ values and the vicarious gains for the NIR band as input (see Appendix C in the supplemental material for more details). Both the MODISA and GOCI data were processed over the GCWS calibration site and have to pass a similar exclusion criteria \citep{Bailey2006}. One of the exclusion criteria was that at least a third of the pixels within the calibration site had to be valid pixels to be included in the gain calculation. The $\bar{g}$ and individual $g_i$ are plotted as a function of mission time for GOCI's visible bands in Fig. \ref{fig:Gvcal_MA}, using ${L_\text{wn}}^\text{t}$ derived from MODISA.

\subsubsection{${L_\text{wn}}^\text{t}$ derived from SeaWiFS climatology}
% Generate an annual daily climatology of the GOCI clear water region from SeaWiFS observations from 1998 to 2009 (11 complete years) and apply this to compute GOCI vicarious gains as Jeremy did for OCTS and CZCS.  You would match the GOCI time point closest in time with SeaWiFS (noonish).  You can then use MODIS, VIIRS and AERONET-OC as independent comparisons (validation) of the GOCI Rrs from 2011 to 2017. 
An annual daily climatology of the GCWS region from SeaWiFS observations from 1998 to 2009 (11 complete years) was generated in a similar fashion as described in \cite{Werdell:07} and used as target values for the vicarious calibration of GOCI's visible bands. Briefly, the SeaWiFS-derived data were organized by day of year and then binned biweekly resulting in a total of 26 sequential 14-day collections. Then, the mean of the semi-interquartile range for each bin was calculated and smoothed using a three-element central moving-average for each bin. Finally, this time series was expanded to every day of the year by applying a cubic spline interpolation. 

The $g_i$ values were obtained by processing the GOCI image acquired at 1:00 PM local time with the SeaWiFS-derived ${L_\text{wn}}^\text{t}$ associated with the day of year of the GOCI image. Again, both the SeaWiFS and GOCI data had to pass the exclusion criteria to be included in the vicarious gain computation, including the criteria that at least a third of the pixels need to be valid pixels. The $\bar{g}$ and individual $g_i$ are plotted as a function of mission time for GOCI's visible bands in Fig. \ref{fig:Gvcal_SW} using ${L_\text{wn}}^\text{t}$ derived from SeaWiFS climatology.

The $\bar{g}$ values and the standard deviation of $g_i$ within the MISQR for all spectral bands are shown in \autoref{tab:vcal_gains_comp} for both approaches. The values between the two different approaches are similar, with a maximum difference of less than $1.6\%$. The values are similar but not identical to previous estimations for other atmospheric correction schemes \citep{Wang:13,Ahn2015}.

\section{Verification of the calibration}
The stability of the vicarious calibration gains for the GOCI bands are tested using two approaches. First, {\it in situ} data from the AERONET-OC were used as matchups to validate the vicarious calibration and the atmospheric algorithm scheme. Second, GOCI-derived data are compared to heritage sensors (i.e. MODISA and VIIRS). 
%-------------------sub-section-----------------------------
\subsection{Validation using AERONET-OC}
% - Validation with AERONET-OC matchus: run GOCI for AERONET-OC matchup
The atmospheric correction and vicarious calibration were validated using matchups from {\it in situ} observations of the AERONET-OC \citep{Zibordi2009}. The quality-assurance (QA) level used was level 2.0, which is the highest quality for the AERONET-OC data. 
The normalized water-leaving radiance $L_\text{wn}$ were downloaded from the AERONET-OC website (\url{https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/}) and converted to remote sensing reflectance ($R_\text{rs}$) by dividing them by the extraterrestrial solar irradiance at the mean Earth-Sun distance ($F_\text{0}$), i.e. $R_\text{rs}=L_\text{wn}/F_\text{0}$. $F_\text{0}$ is calculated from the absolute solar irradiance spectrum derived by \cite{Thuillier2003} by applying a 10 nm square band pass centered on each {\it in situ} wavelength. Also, a BRDF correction is applied as described in \cite{Bailey2006}. 
The dataset from three stations (64 matchups total) included within GOCI's footprint were used for the analysis: Gageocho (N=8; PIs: Jae-Seol Shim and Joo-Hyung Ryu), Ieodo (N=22; PIs: Young-Je Park and Hak-Yeol You), and Socheongcho (N=34, PI: Young-Je Park) (shown in Fig. \ref{fig:GOCI_map} as red circles). The AERONET-OC stations are located in different water types, which is reflected in the scatter plots in Fig. \ref{fig:GOCI_AERO}, with the Ieodo site demonstrating greater $R_\text{rs}$ values than Gageocho and Socheongcho for all bands. 

% Antonio: since we focus on diurnal variability, the time window for the AERONET validation should be reduced to +/- 1 hour because it doesn't make sense to use a 6 hour time window if our premise is that coastal waters express diurnal variability.  AERONET-OC sites are located in coastal waters, and we don't have knowledge as to their diurnal variability.   

The selection of matchups followed the satellite validation protocols described in \cite{Bailey2006}. Th{}e GOCI data were processed to L2 using the SeaDAS/l2gen package with the default atmospheric correction (aer\_opt=-2: multi-scattering with 2-band, RH-based model selection and iterative NIR correction). GOCI data acquired within a 30-minute time window of the AERONET-OC measurements were considered as potential validation matchups. A $5\times5$ GOCI pixel array centered at the {\it in situ} station location is extracted. A filtered mean is calculated from these $5\times5$ arrays in a similar manner as \cite{Bailey2006} but applying the median to filter the data instead of the mean (i.e. $[Median-1.5\times\sigma] <  X_i < [Median+1.5\times\sigma]$ with $X_i$ the value of the $i^{th}$ pixel and $\sigma$ the standard deviation). A minimum of at least half of the total pixels in the $5\times5$ array, were required to be valid (unflagged) for inclusion in the validation analysis. Additionally, a coefficient of variation (CV, filtered mean divided by the filtered standard deviation) for the visible bands 412 to 555 nm and the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 864 nm was calculated for each pixel array that passes the exclusion criteria described above, and then, the median value of these coefficients of variation ($\text{Median}[CV]$) was calculated. Finally, the pixel arrays whose $\text{Median}[CV]>0.15$, as suggested by \cite{Bailey2006}, are excluded from the validation analysis.

A validation analysis was performed by comparing the satellite-derive retrievals of products with the {\it in situ} observations using two performance metrics suggested by \cite{Seegers:18}: the mean bias and the mean absolute error (MAE) (\autoref{tab:val_stats}). The mean bias is defined as 
\begin{equation}
    \text{Mean bias} = \frac{1}{N}\times\sum_{n=1}^N(R_\text{rs:ret}^n-R_\text{rs:in}^n)
\end{equation}
with $R_\text{rs:ret}$ and $R_\text{rs:in}$ the computed filtered mean satellite value and the {\it in situ} measurement of the remote sensing reflectance, respectively. The MAE is defined as 
\begin{equation}
    \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{N}\times\sum_{n=1}^N\left|R_\text{rs:ret}^n-R_\text{rs:in}^n\right|
\end{equation}
These metrics are suggested when the data is non-Gaussian, as in this case, and to minimize the influence of outliers \citep{Seegers:18}. Both the mean bias and the MAE have the same units as the variable under consideration. 

% Antonio: results show some near-zero values at 412 and 443nm?  clearly, there is a bias where GOCI Rrs is generally lower than AERONET.
% Fig. \ref{fig:GOCI_AERO} shows scatter plots for AERONET-OC data versus GOCI matchups. 
% The data were separated by stations and color coded by the times of the day in order to evaluate the influence of the solar zenith angle in the validation matchups. {}
% The statistics calculated for each time of the day and for all matchups (highlighted in bold cases) are shown in \autoref{tab:val_stats}.
The two approaches for the source of ${L_\text{wn}}^\text{t}$, i.e. from MODISA and SeaWiFS Climatology were analyzed using these statistical parameters, which are then compared with results without vicarious calibration (uncalibrated), with the current vicarious calibration included in SeaDAS/l2gen and with the vicarious calibration suggested by \cite{Wang:13} (\autoref{tab:val_stats}).

A good agreement was found between the retrieved $R_\text{rs}$ and {\it in situ} observations for both the MODISA- and SeaWiFS-derived calibrations. These two test approaches perform better than the current vicarious calibration included in SeaDAS, which is reflected in a smaller mean bias and MAE (\autoref{tab:val_stats}). Overall, these approaches also performed better than the uncalibrated data and are comparable with the results based on \cite{Wang:13} that used atmospheric correction implemented in the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (NOAA-MSL12) data processing system. It is worth to mention that although the atmospheric correction schemes in SeaDAS/l2gen and NOAA-MSL12 are based on similar codes, they have differences, and therefore, the validation result with the vicarious gains from \cite{Wang:13} can be less accurate for this particular atmospheric correction scheme.

% , exceeding the values previously reported by \citep{Ahn2015}
% From Antonio: it's not worthwhile to compare individual statistics metrics from another paper, but rather a group a statistics; our results show better (or worse) agreement than Ahn {\it et} al. 2015 based a combination of metrics (R2, RSME, APD, etc.).

\subsection{Sensor Cross-comparison}

% - GOCI time serie: run GOCI with new vcal gains
We computed the time series of monthly means for the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) weather satellite \citep{Wang2014} and MODISA over the same GCWS region for cross-comparison with the time series from GOCI (Fig. \ref{fig:CrossCompAllRrs}). These data were filtered following the same previous exclusion criteria and then averaged by month. For GOCI, the mean of the three midday values were used. All the satellite data from the OB.DAAC used in this study (i.e. MODISA, VIIRS and GOCI) are from the latest reprocessing R2018.0, which incorporates advancements in instrument calibration and updates in the instrument-specific vicarious calibration derived from updated MOBY instrument calibration.

Overall, the monthly GOCI-derived $R_\text{rs}$ followed a similar overall trend as the monthly MODISA and VIIRS values.  Seasonally varying differences are evident, however, with the largest discrepancies during winter (Fig. \ref{fig:CrossCompAllRrs}.(a)). The ratios of $R_\text{rs}$ among all the three showed consistency in all bands, with exception to the red bands (Fig. \ref{fig:CrossCompAllRrs}.(b-d)). For the monthly GOCI/MODISA ratio, the mean value fluctuates around one for the blue-green bands and $1.6$ for the red bands, indicating that the GOCI's red band was generally brighter than MODISA. For the GOCI/VIIRS, the monthly ratio fluctuated around one for all bands with the 660 nm band having a greater spread overall. For the MODISA/VIIRS, the ratio varied close to one as well, except for the 660 nm band, which fluctuated around 0.6, suggesting that the differences observed in the red may be due to error in MODISA rather than GOCI. GOCI-derived $R_\text{rs}$ displayed a consistent behavior from year to year, with no evidence of a relative drift observed over the mission lifetime (Fig. \ref{fig:CrossCompAllRrs}.(a)). However, the sensor-to-sensor monthly ratios display a slight temporal drift suggesting a slight degradation of GOCI compared to the other sensors (Fig. \ref{fig:CrossCompAllRrs}.(b,c)). A regression analysis was performed for all ratios in order to quantitatively assess this degradation using the slopes of this regression (\autoref{tab:slopes}). The slopes of the regression lines (dashed lines in Fig. \ref{fig:CrossCompAllRrs}.(b-d)) fluctuates from $\approx-2.2\times10^{-2}$ per year in the blue to $\approx-6.9\times10^{-2}$ per year in the red for the GOCI-MODISA and GOCI-VIIRS ratios.

All three biogeochemical data products exhibited peaks in late winter to early spring consistent with an increase in phytoplankton biomass and net community production followed by decreases and minimum values between late spring and early autumn. Good consistency in the range of the retrieved values and the phasing of the seasonal cycles was generally found for the three missions and for the three biogeochemical products. Note that certain discrepancies occur for MODISA and GOCI in 2017. This could be caused by problem in the instrument calibrations.

% ----------------------------
% 1 Introduction 2
% GOCI provides capability of studying coastal and ocean processes at an unprecedented temporal scale.

A vicarious calibration for GOCI was presented in this document. This vicarious calibration is specific to the NASA standard atmospheric correction algorithm \citep{Mobley2016}, as distributed by NASA through the SeaDAS/l2gen package. 

% 2 Approach 3
% vicarious calibration
% 2.1 CalibrationoftheNear-InfraredBands............................ 4
The derivation of the vicarious gain for the 745-nm band was based on aerosol properties derived from MODISA over the calibration site. The derived gain is very similar to the value derived by \cite{Wang:13}, also using an Angstrom Coefficient derived from MODISA. 

% 2.2 CalibrationoftheVisibleBands ............................... 5 
% 2.2.1 LwntderivedfromMODISA .......................... 7 
For the derivation of the vicarious gains for the visible bands, two approaches were tested. The first approach used target water-leaving radiance from MODISA. This approach was successful at improving the agreement between GOCI-derived $R_\text{rs}$ and {\it in situ} observations from AERONET-OC by reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) by about 20, 25, 40, 20 and $37\%$ for the 412, 443, 490, 555 and 660 nm bands, respectively, when compared to the current vicarious gains included in SeaDAS version 7.5 (Fig. \ref{fig:GOCI_AERO}; \autoref{tab:val_stats}). Our study demonstrates successful vicarious calibration of GOCI in the absence of data from an {\it in situ} calibration site (e.g. MOBY). Therefore, we recommend the utilization of the vicarious gains obtained from MODISA when processing GOCI data in SeaDAS/l2gen.

% 2.2.2 LwntderivedfromSeaWiFSclimatology...................... 7
The second approach to derive vicarious gains for the visible bands used target water-leaving radiance from a regional climatology from a well-calibrated sensor such as SeaWiFS. This approach reduced the MAE for the 412, 443, 490, 555 and 660 nm bands by about 24, 27, 23, 8 and 32\%, respectively, when compared to the current vicarious gains included in SeaDAS version 7.5 (Fig. \ref{fig:GOCI_AERO}; \autoref{tab:val_stats}). These results proved using climatology is a good alternative when data are not available from {\it in situ} measurements, like MOBY or AERONET-OC, or a concurrent satellite sensor. The vicarious calibration gains for all bands are similar for both approaches of target sources, and they are similar but not identical to previous studies \citep{Wang:13,Ahn2015} (\autoref{tab:vcal_gains_comp}).

% 3 Verification of the calibration 9
% 3.1 ValidationusingAERONET-OC ............................... 10 

% 3.2 SensorCross-comparison................................... 13
When compared with MODISA and VIIRS, seasonally varying differences in $R_\text{rs}$ were observed, with a larger discrepancy in winter and for the red bands (Fig. \ref{fig:CrossCompAllRrs}). The GOCI mission time series of $R_\text{rs}$ demonstrated a consistent behavior from year to year without an evident relative drift (Fig. \ref{fig:CrossCompAllRrs}.(a)). The time series for the mission to mission ratios vary seasonally, fluctuating around a value close to one, with the exception of the red bands. A small drift is observed for the ratios between GOCI and both MODISA and SeaWiFS (Fig. \ref{fig:CrossCompAllRrs}.(c,b)), and most noticeable in the red bands. This is corroborated by a regression analysis with slopes fluctuating from $\approx-2.2\times10^{-2}$ per year in the blue to $\approx-6.9\times10^{-2}$ per year in the red for the GOCI-MODISA and GOCI-VIIRS ratios (\autoref{tab:slopes}). These observations require further study to determine whether there is a genuine relative drift in GOCI radiances. Spectral differences between missions were observed with differences increasing between the blue bands and the red bands (Fig. \ref{fig:scatterRrs})

% \cite{Kang2010}...
 
% 4 Conclusions 16 
With this new set of vicarious gains, SeaDAS/l2gen package can be used to process higher quality L2 GOCI data for ocean color studies than the previous gains. Future work will evaluate whether sub-diurnal to multi-day biogeochemical variability can be distinguished based on our estimated uncertainties of GOCI $R_\text{rs}$.
